# Portfolio Project

![Nova Universe](./src/app/icon.png)

This is a `Node-v20.18.3` and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

If you don't have the `pnpm` installed already, install it with the following commands:

```bash
# using corepack:
corepack enable

# or using npm
npm i --global pnpm
```

then install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

You can run the following commands in the project scope:

```bash

# run the development server
pnpm dev

# build the project
pnpm build

# preview the build result
pnpm start
```

For the dev and preview server, Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Using version manager

You can run the command `nvm use` for switching to the correct node version.

#### Using with direnv

If you have `direnv` installed, you can run the command `direnv allow` once.
after that, node version will change automatically when inside project root.
